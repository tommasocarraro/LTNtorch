    "## Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important problem in Machine Learning is regression, where a relationship is estimated between one independent variable $X$ and a continuous dependent variable $Y$.\n",
    "The essence of regression is, therefore, to approximate a function $f(x) = y$ by a function $f^*$, given examples $(x_i, y_i)$ such that $f(x_i) = y_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In LTN one can model a regression task by defining $f^*$ as a learnable function whose parameter values $\\theta$ are\n",
    "constrained by data. Additionally, a regression task requires a notion of *equality*. We therefore define the\n",
    "predicate $Eq$ as a smooth version of the symbol $=$ in order to turn the constraint $f(x_i) = y_i$ into a smooth\n",
    "optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we explore regression using a problem from a real estate dataset with 414 examples, each described in\n",
    "terms of 6 real-numbered features:\n",
    "- the transaction date (converted to a float);\n",
    "- the age of the house;\n",
    "- the distance to the nearest station;\n",
    "- the number of convenience stores in the vicinity;\n",
    "- the latitude and longitude coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model has to predict the house price given these features in input.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this specific task, LTN uses the following language and grounding:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Domains:**\n",
    "- $samples$, denoting the houses and their features;\n",
    "- $prices$, denoting the house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables:**\n",
    "- $x$ for the samples;\n",
    "- $y$ for the prices;\n",
    "- $D(x) = samples$;\n",
    "- $D(y) = prices$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functions:**\n",
    "- $f^*(x)$: the regression function that has to be learned;\n",
    "- $D_{in}(f^*) = samples$;\n",
    "- $D_{out}(f^*) = prices$, where $D_{out}(.)$ is a function which returns the domain of the output of a given logical\n",
    "function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Predicates:**\n",
    "- $Eq(y_1, y_2)$: a smooth equality predicate which measures how similar $y_1$ and $y_2$ are;\n",
    "- $D_{in}(Eq) = prices, prices$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Axioms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\forall Diag(x,y) \\text{ } Eq(f^*(x), y)$: the output of $f^*$ should be equal to the ground truth $y$ for each\n",
    "example $x$ given in input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice again the use of $Diag$: when grounding $x$ and $y$ onto sequences of values, this is done by obeying a\n",
    "one-to-one correspondence between the sequences. In other words, we aggregate pairs of corresponding samples and prices,\n",
    "instead of any combination thereof.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grounding:**\n",
    "- $\\mathcal{G}(samples)=\\mathbb{R}^{6}$, samples are described by 6 features;\n",
    "- $\\mathcal{G}(prices)=\\mathbb{R}$;\n",
    "- $\\mathcal{G}(x) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times 6}, \\mathcal{G}(y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times 1}$. Notice that this specification\n",
    "refers to the same number $m$ of examples for $x$ and $y$ due to the above one-to-one correspondence\n",
    "obtained with the use of $Diag$;\n",
    "- $\\mathcal{G}(\\mathrm{eq}(\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v}))=\\exp \\left(-\\alpha \\sqrt{\\sum_{j}\\left(u_{j}-v_{j}\\right)^{2}}\\right)$,\n",
    "where the hyper-parameter $\\alpha$ is a real number that scales how strict the smooth equality is. In this example, we use\n",
    "$\\alpha = 0.05$. Intuitively, the smooth equality is $\\operatorname{exp}(- \\alpha d(\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v}))$, where\n",
    "$d(\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v})$ is the Euclidean distance between $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$. It produces a 1 if the\n",
    "distance is zero; as the distance increases, the result decreases exponentially towards 0. In our example, $\\mathbf{u}$\n",
    "will be a vector containing the results of $f^*$ for $j$ samples, while $\\mathbf{v}$ will contain the ground truths\n",
    "associated to the $j$ samples. Our objective is to maximize the truth degree of this predicate;\n",
    "- $\\mathcal{G}(f^*(x) \\mid \\theta): \\operatorname{MLP}_{\\theta}(x)$, where $MLP_{\\theta}$\n",
    "is a Multi-Layer Perceptron which ends in one neuron corresponding to a price prediction (linear activation).\n",
