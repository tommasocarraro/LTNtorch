    "# Grounding in Logic Tensor Networks (LTN)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "The semantics of LTN differs from the standard abstract semantics of First-order Logic (FOL). Specifically, LTN domains are interpreted concretely by tensors in the Real field.\n",
    "\n",
    "To emphasize the fact that LTN interprets symbols which are grounded on real-valued features, we use the term *grounding*, denoted by $\\mathcal{G}$, instead of interpretation.\n",
    "$\\mathcal{G}$ associates a tensor of real numbers to any term of the language, and a real number in the interval $[0,1]$ to any formula $\\phi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of the tutorials, we commonly use \"tensor\" to designate \"tensor in the Real field\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Real Logic language consists of a non-logical part (the signature) and logical connectives and quantifiers.\n",
    "* **constants** denote individuals from some space of tensors $\\bigcup\\limits_{n_1 \\dots n_d \\in \\mathbb{N}^*} \\mathbb{R}^{n_1 \\times \\dots \\times n_d}$ (tensor of any rank). The individuals can be pre-defined (data point) or learnable (embedding).\n",
    "* **variables** denote sequences of individuals.\n",
    "* **functions** can be any mathematical function either pre-defined or learnable. Examples of functions can be distance functions, regressors, etc. Functions can be defined using any operations in PyTorch. They can be linear functions, Deep Neural Networks, and so forth.\n",
    "* **predicates** are represented as mathematical functions that map from some n-ary domain of individuals to a real number in $[0,1]$, which can be interpreted as a truth degree. Examples of predicates can be similarity measures, classifiers, etc.\n",
    "* **connectives** ($\\lnot, \\land, \\lor, \\implies$) are modeled using fuzzy connective operators.\n",
    "* **quantifiers** are defined using fuzzy aggregators.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial explains how to ground constants, variables, functions, and predicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to properly use LTN, we need to import the framework and PyTorch."
